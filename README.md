Private Set Intersection in C++
===============================

This project is an exercise in the Private Pet Intersection with Oblivious Function Evaluation, written in C++. There's a closely equivalent of the same project implemented in Common Lisp. If you are interested in understanding how the PSI algorithm would work with homomorphic encryption method, check it out.


Dependencies
------------

 * CMake 3.4
 * GCC 4.8+ or Apple Clang 6.3+ or equivalent (these are the tested compilers at least)
 * Boost Libraries 1.58.0+

Building
--------

It's a very simple project so there should be no complications.

    mkdir ../build-psi-cpp
		cd ../build-psi-cpp
		cmake ../[directory-of-the-clone]
		make

Running
-------

The executable isn't configurable so you need to fiddle with the input and output. It is because I was just trying to a quick job of it. Later perhaps I revisit and make it more general, a good source for learning.
